THE GREATEST SNOW APP EVER

## Installing the Ionic Framework

Follow this guide: http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/

## Running on local browser

Run the following command on the command line interface:
`ionic serve --lab`

This will show the app in an interface similar to a smartphone screen.

## Running on iOS devices

Ensure you have iOS development tools and Mac OSX installed.

Connect your iOS device to your computer.

Run the following command on the command line interface:

1) `ionic platform ios` to select iOS as your target platform

2) `ionic build ios` to build the app for iOS

3) `ionic run ios` to run the app on your iOS device.

If you do not have an iOS device connected, the command `ionic run ios` will run on an emulator.

## Running on Android devices

Connect your Android device to your computer.

Run the following command on the command line interface:

1) `ionic platform android` to select Android as your target platform

2) `ionic build android` to build the app for Android

3) `ionic run Android` to run the app on your Android device.

If you do not have an Android device connected, the command `ionic run Android` will run on an emulator.

## Testing

Unit testing will be done via karma/jasmine. Unit tests should go in the tests/unit-tests directory.
In order to run tests, navigate to /tests/ and run in command line: `karma start unit-tests.conf.js`.
Tests will continue to run as code is changed, unless otherwise specified.

Need to install the following:

```
$ npm install karma --save-dev
$ npm install karma-jasmine --save-dev
$ bower install angular-mocks#1.5.3 --save-dev
$ npm install -g karma-cli
$ npm install -g phantomjs
$ npm install jasmine-core --save-dev
```
may need to also install if you get this error:
Cannot load browser "PhantomJS": it is not registered! Perhaps you are missing some plugin?

```
npm install karma-phantomjs-launcher --save-dev

```


## Build Errors and Resolutions

1) Node Sass could not find a binding for your current environment:

Run the following command on the CLI: `npm rebuild node-sass`
